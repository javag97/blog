One of my favorite books I've read is *Heart of Darkness* by Joseph Conrad. In Heart of Darkness, a seaman travels into Africa to meet a famous ivory trader named Kurtz. What he ends of finding is a powerhungry man broken by his own needs and desires.  In this book, I find wisdom that explains how humanity's deepest desires are restricted by social rules that various cultures look to adopt. This book exists as an explination for all manmade authorities commited against ourselves such as imperialism, war, and genocide.

Let me connect the dots to the current pandemic. As of March 2020, various counties in the San Francisco Bay Area are under lock-down; the govenment is mandating that people stay at home may leave their homes to reach essential goods like food and medicine. At this time, health experts recommend that people practice *social distancing*, where people maintain at least six feet from each other. From this social panic, we find that people are hoarding supplies, ignoring reccomendations set by the government, uttering racially charged statements against Chinese individuals, and spreading misinformation. 

I want to specifically talk to those that aren't directly affected by the coronavirus. If you aren't personally affected by the virus, remember that someone you love is. Look after those in the community around you that are in need. For us to overcome, we must come together. Out of many, one.
