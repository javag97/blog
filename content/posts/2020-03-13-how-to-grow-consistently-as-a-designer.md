## Consistency > Intensity 

I often find in hustle culture that people are encouraged to give up everything for the sake of getting a new job, or getting that sweet promotion you've been looking for.  Now, this isn't problemaic in periods of occasional stress. This becomes a problem when people begin to confuse  consitent and frequent work with intense yet sporatic work. 

The only problem comes when a habit to stay in the office far too long becomes unsustainable. When one begins to hate coming in, one stops to show up. When growth isn't constant and steady, then that's when people begin to plateau in their skills and in their careers. 

I want to make it clear that I am not arguing against hard work. There is a time and place for intensity. Again, the problem lies when people begin to loathe working long hours. When that begins to happen, people are less likely to want to work consistently.

If you're interested in growing consistently, you the most important thing to do is to **build healthy habits.** Society often reinforces that “the struggle” is what will lead to growth. I'm here to challenge that and I think others are too. 


### **Summary** 

> A one percent daily improvement compounds itself to a 3700% improvement over the course of a year. If one grows 10% one day, then stops, one has only grown 10%.
