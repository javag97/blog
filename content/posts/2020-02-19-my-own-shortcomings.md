Welcome to my first blog post! The reason I created this blog was to find a way to write my own thoughts and to track them.

For the past month, I had been working in open source as a *developer.* I am very grateful that the opportunity at doing that, but found that the work to be too challenging given my background as a Product Designer. I was unsure what to expect from such opportunity especially knowing that it was a developer first environment. I believe this to be a miscommunication from both parties, and that there was plenty I could have done to prevent that situation.

My advice to others is to let go of your ego. Be honest with yourself and others. Everyone will appreciate that.
